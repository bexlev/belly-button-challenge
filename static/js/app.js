function createBar(id){
    // code that makes bar chart at id='bar'

    // checking to see if function is running
    console.log(`This function generates bar chart of ${id} `)

}

function createSummary(id){
    // code that makes list, paragraph, text/linebreaks at id='sample-meta'

// STRATEGIES
// 1.  Inside-Out:  Generate each chart by assuming an ID/name then refactor the code to 
//                  work for any ID/name coming from the function.  I typically do this practice.
// 2.  Outside-In:  Generate the control (dropdown) and how the control interacts with the other parts.
//                  I gave you the basics of how it interacts above.  You could generate the dropdown
//                  and then see in the console the ID/names update as you make a change.  Then you could
//                  make your chart code.

// Overall, the above are the two steps you need to do (1.  Make plots with data, 2. make dropdown that passes id to functions)
// You could do it in either order.
